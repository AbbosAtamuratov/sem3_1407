### Little note

I've read somewwhere that MARKDOWN is based of HTML and can be easelly converted to it. It also means that you can use all HTML commands in MD. 

For example, to make your text underlined use HTML command (< u > and < /u > without spaces) to get <u> underlined text </u>.

## QUOTES 

To mark something as qoute use (>) symbol in front of your text

> this is a quote

You can make qoutes with multiple rows, just use (>) symbol in your blank row

> this is 
>
> a quote
>
> with multiple
>
> rows

Also you can incapsulate your quotes in other quotes. Just use additional (>) symbol in your quote

> In fact 
>>you
>>>can
>>>>do
>>>>>it
>>>>>>as long
>>>>>>>as you
>>>>>>>>please

## HEADERS

There are 6 grades of titlles in markdown that you can use to format your titles. To do that frame your title with (#) symbol (In fact you can just put it only in front of you title). To differenciate between them use addicional (#) symbols

# title 1

## title 2

### title 3

##### title 5

###### title 6
<br></br>
Always divide your title with space otherwise it won't trigger or show exess (#) symbols

>#tiltle without space after (#)
